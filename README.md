# protonMailGenerator
A E-Mail Generator


## WHAT MAKES THIS BETTER


The mail is ready when the script is done. It will already be VERIFIED and NO further manual VERIFICATION needed not like at other generators

### USAGE

It is used to generate a protonmail mail for you which you can fully access

Firefox as standard browser is recommended but not must have (for chrome or other browsers just use the chromegen.py)



## HOW TO USE

install python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
and don't forget to add python to your PATH

open cmd and type in:
  
  pip install Pillow
  
  pip install pyautogui

(write everything individually)

then start by either writing py generator.py/chromegen.py in your commandline or 
clicking the launch.cmd
be sure to click nothing while the script is running otherwise you could interfere with it!
when finished you can find the mail and password in the accLog.txt
enjoy!

#### EXCUSES:
My first python code ever kinda bad but it works. Rn I am working on a selenium version of this because using the webbrowser and pyautogui is really bad for this usecase ig.
